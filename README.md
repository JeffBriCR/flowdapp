# FLOW dApp

Agile kanban boards for distributed organizations.

DAC Kanban leverages all the power of EOSIO blockchains to deliver real-time transactions with zero transactions fees.

DAC Kanban allows you to get things done faster and get rewarded as things get done.

## What is Kanban ?

Kanban (看板) (signboard or billboard in Japanese) is a scheduling system for lean manufacturing and just-in-time manufacturing (JIT). Taiichi Ohno, an industrial engineer at Toyota, developed kanban to improve manufacturing efficiency. Kanban is one method to achieve JIT. 

Kanban became an effective tool to support running a production system as a whole, and an excellent way to promote improvement.

Kanban is all about visualizing your work, limiting work in progress, and maximizing efficiency(or flow). Kanban teams focus on reducing the time it takes to take a project (or user story) from start to finish. They do this by using a kanban board and continuously improving their flow of work.
