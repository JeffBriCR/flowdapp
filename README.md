# DAC Kanban

An agile kanban board for your decentralized organization.

DAC Kanban allows you to get things done faster and get rewarded as things get done.

## What is a DAC ?

An organization that is controlled by stakeholders rather than a central authority.

One difficult problem for DACs and other Open Source projects is onboarding new collaborators, DAC Kanban solves this issue by clearly defining scoped tasks people can take from a prioritized To Do list and they have guaratee they'll get rewarded once the task in hand is completed. This provides a much simple path to join any type of decentralized organization.

## What is Kanban ?

Kanban (看板) (signboard or billboard in Japanese) is a scheduling system for lean manufacturing and just-in-time manufacturing (JIT). Taiichi Ohno, an industrial engineer at Toyota, developed kanban to improve manufacturing efficiency. Kanban is one method to achieve JIT. 

Kanban became an effective tool to support running a production system as a whole, and an excellent way to promote improvement.

## What is an Agile Kanban Board?

Agile is a structured and iterative approach to project management and product development. It recognizes the volatility of product development, and provides a methodology for self-organizing teams to respond to change without going off the rails. 

Kanban is all about visualizing your work, limiting work in progress, and maximizing efficiency(or flow). Kanban teams focus on reducing the time it takes to take a project (or user story) from start to finish. They do this by using a kanban board and continuously improving their flow of work.
