# EOS Kanban

Your agile kanban board on the EOS blockchain. 

EOS Kanban allows you to get things done faster and get paid as things get done.

EOS Kanban leverages all the power of the EOS blockchain to deliver real-time transactions with zero transactions fees.

## What is Kanban ?

Kanban (看板) (signboard or billboard in Japanese) is a scheduling system for lean manufacturing and just-in-time manufacturing (JIT). Taiichi Ohno, an industrial engineer at Toyota, developed kanban to improve manufacturing efficiency. Kanban is one method to achieve JIT. 

Kanban became an effective tool to support running a production system as a whole, and an excellent way to promote improvement.

## What is an Agile Kanban Board?

Agile is a structured and iterative approach to project management and product development. It recognizes the volatility of product development, and provides a methodology for self-organizing teams to respond to change without going off the rails. 

Kanban is all about visualizing your work, limiting work in progress, and maximizing efficiency(or flow). Kanban teams focus on reducing the time it takes to take a project(or user story) from start to finish. They do this by using a kanban board and continuously improving their flow of work.
